    <h1 class="pros">MY Portfolio</h1>
<p class="pro-dis">I designed and developed a responsive personal portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, 
    aimed at showcasing my skills and projects effectively. The website features distinct sections 
    including a personalized home page with a captivating background image and introduction, an about 
    section detailing my technical skills and professional journey, and a projects section highlighting key projects
     with descriptions and links to GitHub repositories or live demos. Additionally, I integrated a contact form to 
     facilitate visitor inquiries, employing JavaScript for form validation and submission handling to ensure seamless user interaction. This project not only demonstrates my proficiency in frontend web development technologies such as HTML5, CSS3 (including Flexbox and Grid), and JavaScript (DOM manipulation), but also underscores my ability to create a user-friendly interface with responsive design principles. Hosted on a personal domain using GitHub Pages, this portfolio enhances my online presence, 
    aids in networking, and serves as a dynamic showcase of my evolving skills and achievements in web development.</p>
