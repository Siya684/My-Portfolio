The website features distinct sections including a personalized home page with a captivating background image and introduction, an about section detailing my technical skills and professional journey, and a projects section highlighting key projects with descriptions and links to GitHub repositories or live demos. Additionally, I integrated a contact form to facilitate visitor inquiries, employing JavaScript for form validation and submission handling to ensure seamless user interaction.
